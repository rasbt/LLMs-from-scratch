# Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)

This repository contains the code for coding, pretraining, and finetuning a GPT-like LLM and is the official code repository for the book [Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)](http://mng.bz/orYv).

(If you downloaded the code bundle from the Manning website, please consider visiting the official code repository on GitHub at [https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch).)

In [*Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)*](http://mng.bz/orYv), you'll discover how LLMs work from the inside out. In this book, I'll guide you step by step through creating your own LLM, explaining each stage with clear text, diagrams, and examples. 

The method described in this book for training and developing your own small-but-functional model for educational purposes mirrors the approach used in creating large-scale foundational models such as those behind ChatGPT.
