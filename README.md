# Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)

This repository contains the code for developing, pretraining, and finetuning a GPT-like LLM and is the official code repository for the book [Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)](https://amzn.to/4fqvn0D).

In [*Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)*](http://mng.bz/orYv), you'll learn and understand how large language models (LLMs) work from the inside out by coding them from the ground up, step by step. In this book, I'll guide you through creating your own LLM, explaining each stage with clear text, diagrams, and examples.

The method described in this book for training and developing your own small-but-functional model for educational purposes mirrors the approach used in creating large-scale foundational models such as those behind ChatGPT. In addition, this book includes code for loading the weights of larger pretrained models for finetuning.

The mental model below summarizes the contents covered in this book.

<br>
&nbsp;

## Prerequisites

The most important prerequisite is a strong foundation in Python programming.
With this knowledge, you will be well prepared to explore the fascinating world of LLMs
and understand the concepts and code examples presented in this book.

If you have some experience with deep neural networks, you may find certain concepts more familiar, as LLMs are built upon these architectures.

This book uses PyTorch to implement the code from scratch without using any external LLM libraries. While proficiency in PyTorch is not a prerequisite, familiarity with PyTorch basics is certainly useful. If you are new to PyTorch, Appendix A provides a concise introduction to PyTorch. Alternatively, you may find my book, [PyTorch in One Hour: From Tensors to Training Neural Networks on Multiple GPUs](https://sebastianraschka.com/teaching/pytorch-1h/), helpful for learning about the essentials.



<br>
&nbsp;

## Hardware Requirements

The code in the main chapters of this book is designed to run on conventional laptops within a reasonable timeframe and does not require specialized hardware. This approach ensures that a wide audience can engage with the material. Additionally, the code automatically utilizes GPUs if they are available. (Please see the [setup](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/blob/main/setup/README.md) doc for additional recommendations.)


&nbsp;
## Video Course

[A 17-hour and 15-minute companion video course](https://www.manning.com/livevideo/master-and-build-large-language-models) where I code through each chapter of the book. The course is organized into chapters and sections that mirror the book's structure so that it can be used as a standalone alternative to the book or complementary code-along resource.

&nbsp;


## Companion Book / Sequel

[*Build A Reasoning Model (From Scratch)*](https://mng.bz/lZ5B), while a standalone book, can be considered as a sequel to *Build A Large Language Model (From Scratch)*.

It starts with a pretrained model and implements different reasoning approaches, including inference-time scaling, reinforcement learning, and distillation, to improve the model's reasoning capabilities. 

Similar to *Build A Large Language Model (From Scratch)*, [*Build A Reasoning Model (From Scratch)*](https://mng.bz/lZ5B) takes a hands-on approach implementing these methods from scratch.

## Exercises

Each chapter of the book includes several exercises. The solutions are summarized in Appendix C, and the corresponding code notebooks are available in the main chapter folders of this repository (for example,  [./ch02/01_main-chapter-code/exercise-solutions.ipynb](./ch02/01_main-chapter-code/exercise-solutions.ipynb).

In addition to the code exercises, you can download a free 170-page PDF titled  [Test Yourself On Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)](https://www.manning.com/books/test-yourself-on-build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch) from the Manning website. It contains approximately 30 quiz questions and solutions per chapter to help you test your understanding.

## Questions, Feedback, and Contributing to This Repository


I welcome all sorts of feedback, best shared via the [Manning Forum](https://livebook.manning.com/forum?product=raschka&page=1) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/discussions). Likewise, if you have any questions or just want to bounce ideas off others, please don't hesitate to post these in the forum as well.

Please note that since this repository contains the code corresponding to a print book, I currently cannot accept contributions that would extend the contents of the main chapter code, as it would introduce deviations from the physical book. Keeping it consistent helps ensure a smooth experience for everyone.
