# Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) Tokenizer From Scratch

- [bpe-from-scratch-simple.ipynb](bpe-from-scratch-simple.ipynb) contains optional (bonus) code that explains and shows how the BPE tokenizer works under the hood; this is geared for simplicity and readability.

- [bpe-from-scratch.ipynb](bpe-from-scratch.ipynb) implements a more sophisticated (and much more complicated) BPE tokenizer that behaves similarly as tiktoken with respect to all the edge cases; it also has additional funcitionality for loading the official GPT-2 vocab.
