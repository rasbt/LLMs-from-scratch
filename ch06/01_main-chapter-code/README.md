# Chapter 6: Finetuning for Classification

### Main Chapter Code

- [ch06.ipynb](ch06.ipynb) contains all the code as it appears in the chapter
- [previous_chapters.py](previous_chapters.py)  is a Python module that contains the GPT model we coded and trained in previous chapters, alongside many utility functions, which we reuse in this chapter
- [gpt_download.py](gpt_download.py) contains the utility functions for downloading the pretrained GPT model weights
- [exercise-solutions.ipynb](exercise-solutions.ipynb) contains the exercise solutions for this chapter

### Optional Code

[load-finetuned-model.ipynb](load-finetuned-model.ipynb) is a standalone Jupyter notebook to load the finetuned model we created in this chapter


- [gpt_class_finetune.py](gpt_class_finetune.py) is a standalone Python script file with the code that we implemented in [ch06.ipynb](ch06.ipynb) to finetune the GPT model (you can think of it as a chapter summary)
