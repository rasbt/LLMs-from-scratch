# Additional Experiments Classifying the Sentiment of 50k IMDb Movie Reviews

## Overview

This folder contains additional experiments to compare the (decoder-style) GPT-2 (2018) model from chapter 6 to encoder-style LLMs like [BERT (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), [RoBERTa (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692), and [ModernBERT (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13663). Instead of using the small SPAM dataset from Chapter 6, we are using the 50k movie review dataset from IMDb ([dataset source](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)) with a binary classification objective, predicting whether a reviewer liked the movie or not. This is a balanced dataset, so a random prediction should yield 50% accuracy.

| **8** | Logistic Regression Baseline | 88.85%        |
