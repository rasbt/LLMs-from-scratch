# Python Setup Tips



There are several ways to install Python and set up your computing environment. Here, I share my personal preferences.

<br>

> **Note:**
> If you are running any of the notebooks on Google Colab and want to install the dependencies, simply run the following code in a new cell at the top of the notebook and skip the rest of this tutorial:
> `pip install uv && uv pip install --system -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/refs/heads/main/requirements.txt`

The remaining sections below describe how you can manage your Python environment and packages on your local machine.

I have been a long-time user of [Conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), but recently, the [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package has gained significant traction as it provides a faster and more efficient way to install packages and resolve dependencies.

I recommend starting with *Option 1: Using uv* as it is the more modern approach in 2025. If you encounter problems with *Option 1*, consider *Option 2: Using Conda*.

In this tutorial, I am using a computer running macOS, but this workflow is similar for Linux machines and may work for other operating systems as well.


&nbsp;
# Option 1: Using uv

This section guides you through the Python setup and package installation procedure using `uv` via its `uv pip` interface. The `uv pip` interface may feel more familiar to most Python users who have used pip before than the native `uv` commands.

&nbsp;
> **Note:**
> There are alternative ways to install Python and use `uv`. For example, you can install Python directly via `uv` and use `uv add` instead of `uv pip install` for even faster package management.
>
> If you are a macOS or Linux user and prefer the native `uv` commands, refer to the [./native-uv.md tutorial](./native-uv.md). I also recommend checking the official [`uv` documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
>
> The `uv add` syntax also applies to Windows users. However, I found that some dependencies in the `pyproject.toml` cause problems on Windows. So, for Windows users, I recommend `pix` instead, which has a similar `pixi add` workflow like `uv add`. For more information, see the [./native-pixi.md tutorial](./native-pixi.md).
>
> While `uv add` and `pixi add` offer additional speed advantages, I think that `uv pip` is slightly more user-friendly, making it a good starting point for beginners. However, if you're new to Python package management, the native `uv` interface is also a great opportunity to learn it from the start. It's also how I use `uv` now, but I realize it the barrier to entry is a bit higher if you are coming from `pip` and `conda`.




&nbsp;
## 1. Install Python (if not installed)

If you haven't manually installed Python on your system before, I highly recommend doing so. This helps prevent potential conflicts with your operating system's built-in Python installation, which could lead to issues.

However, even if you have installed Python on your system before, check if you have a modern version of Python installed (I recommend 3.10 or newer) by executing the following code in the terminal:

```bash
python --version
```
If it returns 3.10 or newer, no further action is required.

&nbsp;
> **Note:**
> If `python --version` indicates that no Python version is installed, you may also want to check `python3 --version` since your system might be configured to use the `python3` command instead.

&nbsp;
> **Note:**
> I recommend installing a Python version that is at least 2 versions older than the most recent release to ensure PyTorch compatibility. For example, if the most recent version is Python 3.13, I recommend installing version 3.10 or 3.11.

Otherwise, if Python is not installed or is an older version, you can install it for your operating system as described below.

<br>

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.10 python3.10-venv python3.10-dev
```

<br>

**macOS**

If you use Homebrew, install Python with:

```bash
brew install python@3.10
```

Alternatively, download and run the installer from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

<br>

**Windows**

Download and run the installer from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


&nbsp;

## 2. Create a virtual environment

I highly recommend installing Python packages in a separate virtual environment to avoid modifying system-wide packages that your OS may depend on. To create a virtual environment in the current folder, follow the three steps below.

<br>

**1. Install uv**

```bash
pip install uv
```

<br>

**2. Create the virtual environment**

```bash
uv venv --python=python3.10
```

<br>

**3. Activate the virtual environment**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

&nbsp;
> **Note:**
> If you are using Windows, you may have to replace the command above by `source .venv/Scripts/activate` or `.venv/Scripts/activate`.



Note that you need to activate the virtual environment each time you start a new terminal session. For example, if you restart your terminal or computer and want to continue working on the project the next day, simply run `source .venv/bin/activate` in the project folder to reactivate your virtual environment.

<img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/setup/uv-setup/venv-activate-1.png" width="600" height="auto" alt="Venv activated">

Optionally, you can deactivate the environment it by executing the command `deactivate`.

<img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/setup/uv-setup/venv-activate-2.png" width="800" height="auto" alt="Venv deactivated">

&nbsp;
## 3. Install packages

After activating your virtual environment, you can install Python packages using `uv`. For example:

```bash
uv pip install packaging
```

To install all required packages from a `requirements.txt` file (such as the one located at the top level of this GitHub repository) run the following command, assuming the file is in the same directory as your terminal session:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Alternatively, install the latest dependencies directly from the repository:

```bash
uv pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/refs/heads/main/requirements.txt
```


<img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/setup/uv-setup/uv-install.png" width="700" height="auto" alt="Uv install">

&nbsp;

> **Note:**
> If you have problems with the following commands above due to certain dependencies (for example, if you are using Windows), you can always fall back to using regular pip:
> `pip install -r requirements.txt`
> or
> `pip install -U -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/refs/heads/main/requirements.txt`

&nbsp;

> **Optional dependencies for bonus materials:**
> To include the optional dependencies used throughout the bonus materials, install the `bonus` dependency group from the project root:
>  `uv pip install --group bonus`
> This is useful if you don't want to install them separately as you check out the optional bonus materials later on.

<br>

**Finalizing the setup**

Thatâ€™s it! Your environment should now be ready for running the code in the repository.

Optionally, you can run an environment check by executing the `python_environment_check.py` script in this repostiory:

```bash
python setup/02_installing-python-libraries/python_environment_check.py
```

<img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/setup/uv-setup/env-check.png" width="700" height="auto" alt="Environment check">

If you encounter any issues with specific packages, try reinstalling them using:

```bash
uv pip install packagename
```

(Here, `packagename` is a placeholder name that needs to be replaced with the package name you are having problems with.)

If problems persist, consider [opening a discussion](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/discussions) on GitHub or working through the *Option 2: Using Conda* section below.

<br>

**Start working with the code**

Once everything is set up, you can start working with the code files. For instance, launch [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) by running:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

&nbsp;
> **Note:**
> If you encounter problems with the jupyter lab command, you can also start it using the full path inside your virtual environment. For example, use `.venv/bin/jupyter lab` on Linux/macOS or `.venv\Scripts\jupyter-lab` on Windows.

# Option 2: Using Conda



This section guides you through the Python setup and package installation procedure using [`conda`](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=conda&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) via [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

In this tutorial, I am using a computer running macOS, but this workflow is similar for Linux machines and may work for other operating systems as well.


&nbsp;
## 1. Download and install Miniforge

Download miniforge from the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

<img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/setup/01_optional-python-setup-preferences/download.png" alt="download" width="600px">

Depending on your operating system, this should download either an `.sh` (macOS, Linux) or `.exe` file (Windows).

For the `.sh` file, open your command line terminal and execute the following command

```bash
sh ~/Desktop/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh
```

where `Desktop/` is the folder where the Miniforge installer was downloaded to. On your computer, you may have to replace it with `Downloads/`.

<img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/setup/01_optional-python-setup-preferences/miniforge-install.png" alt="miniforge-install" width="600px">

Next, step through the download instructions, confirming with "Enter".


&nbsp;
## 2. Create a new virtual environment

After the installation was successfully completed, I recommend creating a new virtual environment called `LLMs`, which you can do by executing

```bash
conda create -n LLMs python=3.10
```

<img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/setup/01_optional-python-setup-preferences/new-env.png" alt="new-env" width="600px">

> Many scientific computing libraries do not immediately support the newest version of Python. Therefore, when installing PyTorch, it's advisable to use a version of Python that is one or two releases older. For instance, if the latest version of Python is 3.13, using Python 3.10 or 3.11 is recommended.

Next, activate your new virtual environment (you have to do it every time you open a new terminal window or tab):

```bash
conda activate LLMs
```

<img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/setup/01_optional-python-setup-preferences/activate-env.png" alt="activate-env" width="600px">


&nbsp;
## Optional: styling your terminal

If you want to style your terminal similar to mine so that you can see which virtual environment is active,  check out the [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) project.

&nbsp;
## 3. Install new Python libraries



To install new Python libraries, you can now use the `conda` package installer. For example, you can install [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install) and [watermark](https://github.com/rasbt/watermark) as follows:

```bash
conda install jupyterlab watermark
```

<img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/setup/01_optional-python-setup-preferences/conda-install.png" alt="conda-install" width="600px">



You can also still use `pip` to install libraries. By default, `pip` should be linked to your new `LLms` conda environment:

<img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/setup/01_optional-python-setup-preferences/check-pip.png" alt="check-pip" width="600px">

&nbsp;
## 4. Install PyTorch

PyTorch can be installed just like any other Python library or package using pip. For example:

```bash
pip install torch
```

However, since PyTorch is a comprehensive library featuring CPU- and GPU-compatible codes, the installation may require additional settings and explanation (see the *A.1.3 Installing PyTorch in the book for more information*).

It's also highly recommended to consult the installation guide menu on the official PyTorch website at [https://pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org).
